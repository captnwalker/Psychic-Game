### Unresolved Issues

* Random letter resets with each key stroke, should persist for the duration of the game.

* Letters already guessed may be regenrated as the computers random pick.

* Loss correctly resets Remaining Guesses to 10 for the new round, however a Win incorrectly resets Remaining Guesses to 9
